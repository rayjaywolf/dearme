# Deployment and Version Control Guidelines

## Git Workflow

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `develop`: Development branch
   - Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
   - Bug fix branches: `fix/bug-name`

2. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

## Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment Checklist**
   - Run Theme Check
   - Test on development store
   - Verify all features work
   - Check responsive design
   - Validate performance

2. **Deployment Steps**
   - Create a new theme version
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Test thoroughly on staging
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor for issues

## Version Control Files

- [.gitignore](mdc:.gitignore): Specifies files to ignore
- [.shopifyignore](mdc:.shopifyignore): Specifies files to exclude from theme
- [.theme-check.yml](mdc:.theme-check.yml): Theme linting configuration

## Best Practices

1. Never commit sensitive data
2. Keep node_modules in .gitignore
3. Document major changes
4. Use meaningful version numbers
5. Maintain a changelog
